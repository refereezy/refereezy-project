  - Use Android Architecture Components
  - Document public APIs

### Testing

- Write unit tests for each new feature or bug fix
- Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a PR
- For complex features, add integration tests

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any feature changes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Follow the MkDocs format for consistency

## Git Workflow

1. **Main Branches**
   - `main` - Production-ready code
   - `develop` - Integration branch for features

2. **Feature Development**
   - Branch from `develop`
   - Name: `feature/descriptive-name`
   - Merge back to `develop` via PR

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Critical fixes: Branch from `main`, name: `hotfix/issue-description`
   - Regular fixes: Branch from `develop`, name: `fix/issue-description`

4. **Commit Messages**
   - Use clear, descriptive messages
   - Follow the format: `[Component] Brief description`
   - Example: `[API] Fix user authentication timeout issue`

## Release Process

1. Feature freeze on `develop`
2. Create a release branch: `release/vX.Y.Z`
3. Testing and bug fixing on the release branch
4. When ready, merge to `main` and tag with version
5. Merge back to `develop`
