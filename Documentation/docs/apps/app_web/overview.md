    E --> E3[Report Archive Component]
```

### API Integration

The web application communicates with the Refereezy API for data operations:

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Real-time Implementation

Real-time features are implemented through:

- **Firebase Listeners**: For match data synchronization
- **Socket.IO**: For low-latency updates and notifications
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: For immediate feedback before server confirmation

Example Firebase integration:

```javascript
// Initialize Firebase match listener
const initializeMatchListener = (matchId) => {
  const matchRef = firebase.database().ref(`matches/${matchId}`);
  
  matchRef.on('value', (snapshot) => {
    const matchData = snapshot.val();
    if (matchData) {
      dispatch(updateMatchData(matchData));
    }
  });
  
  return () => matchRef.off(); // Cleanup function
};
```

### Responsive Design

The web application is designed to be responsive across:

- Desktop browsers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

This is achieved through:

- Tailwind CSS responsive classes
- Flex and Grid layouts
- Mobile-first approach to UI design
- Device-specific optimizations

## User Interface

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides a personalized overview based on user role:

- **For Administrators**: System statistics, pending approvals, and recent activity
- **For Referees**: Upcoming matches, recent reports, and personal statistics
- **For Team Managers**: Team performance, player statistics, and match schedule
- **For Spectators**: Featured matches, favorite teams, and live events

### Match Viewer

The match viewer provides a comprehensive view of ongoing and past matches:

- **Scoreboard**: Prominent display of team scores
- **Match Clock**: Current match time and period
- **Team Information**: Logos, colors, and lineup
- **Incident Timeline**: Chronological list of match events
- **Statistics Panel**: Real-time statistics for teams and players

### Report Interface

The report interface allows for viewing and editing match reports:

- **Structured Sections**: Organized by match phases and incident types
