# API Overview

## Introduction

The Refereezy API provides a robust interface for interacting with the platform's core functionality. It handles static client data storage and serves as the backend for all applications in the Refereezy ecosystem. This RESTful API allows developers to create, read, update, and delete resources such as matches, teams, players, and referee reports.

## Architecture

The API follows a modern architecture using:

- **FastAPI** - High-performance web framework for building APIs
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database for storing static client data
- **Firebase** - Real-time document database for storing match events and real-time updates

## Base URL

```
Production: https://api.refereezy.com/v1
Testing: http://localhost:8888
```

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. All requests to protected endpoints must include a valid token in the Authorization header.

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

## Available Endpoints

The API is organized around the following main resources:

- **Matches** - Managing sports matches
- **Teams** - Managing teams participating in matches
- **Players** - Managing players on teams
- **Referees** - Managing referee accounts and permissions
- **Match Reports** - Creating and retrieving match reports
- **Clock** - Managing match timekeeping

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage of the API, rate limiting is applied:

- 100 requests per minute for authenticated users
- 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated users

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

- 2xx - Success
- 4xx - Client error
- 5xx - Server error

All error responses include a JSON body with an error message and additional details when available.
